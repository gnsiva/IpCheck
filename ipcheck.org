** Writing
*** TODO First write simple read me, then a proper tutorial
*** TODO Finish the tutorial
**** TODO Write the intro to the whole thing
Mention RPi's as many people may already have them on all the time
Also if you need the IP for ssh, the computer will be on anyways
Mention subsonic

You can say about my server having bare spare power so its not an issue
But with RPi servers you probably want to do it less frequently
**** TODO Briefly mention bug fixing
Say where the email comes in and how to look at it
cat /var/mail/gns
*** TODO Make a blog entry
