** Coding
*** TODO Stop the program printing anything
Otherwise root sends you an email everytime...
... not cool 
thats to the internal athena email access with:
cat /var/mail/gns
** Code maintenance
*** TODO Setup git repo for the project
*** TODO Write more comments
*** TODO Add a banner (with Author name and stuff)
** Writing
*** TODO Finish the tutorial
**** TODO Write the intro to the whole thing
Mention RPi's as many people may already have them on all the time
Also if you need the IP for ssh, the computer will be on anyways
Mention subsonic
**** TODO Write intro for cron, say how to run it every hour
You can say about my server having bare spare power so its not an issue
But with RPi servers you probably want to do it less frequently
**** TODO Briefly mention bug fixing
Say where the email comes in and how to look at it
cat /var/mail/gns

*** TODO When your web skills get good make a web page!
